## Flathub Keys

Every six months, the keys used to push Thunderbird releases to Flathub expire
and need to be regenerated.

developer portal

2. Click your profile icon in the top right corner of the page, and then select
`Developer Portal` from the drop-down menu

3. Under `Authored apps`, select the release channel of Thunderbird for which
you'd like to update keys

4. Select either `New beta token` or `New stable token` as needed
